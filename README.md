# Pirko Creative - Portfolio Website Design & Development
This project was completed as my last assignment for the SEDC Web Design Bootcamp. We were required to build a portfolio website to showcase all of the work we had done while taking classes there.

When it came to using a site builder, framework, or content management system, the professors allowed us complete freedom.

I debated utilizing Wordpress against going static but ultimately chose to develop my portfolio using static HTML/CSS and JS. The advantages of static sites include speed, security, and the opportunity to host them for free on services like Netlify.

I wanted to develop a website that was incredibly simple to use for visitors of all ages while also coming up with something unique that reflected who I am personally.

While working in Visual Studio Code, the concept for my website design struck me.

Since I really liked the look of the code editor, why not use it to build my website?

I launched Figma after that, tried out a couple of wireframes, and ultimately fell in love with the concept. Although this website it's pretty simple, I love how it turned out.
